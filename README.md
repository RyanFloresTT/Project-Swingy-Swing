# Project Swingy Swing

I am no longer working on this project. I made some good progress, but at the end of the day, I was feeling out of creative juice for this game and couldn't make decisions quick enough to get a good idea of what this game was supposed to end up being. I have below a few things I managed to create and a tiny level is included in the source. I also left a lot of the ideas here to show what I had in mind when I first thought of this project, but know that it turned out nothing like it :D. This was my first time in 3D and it was great to learn and get more comfortable with it, I'm sure to use what I've learned in a future project.

## Project Inception

* While browsing on YouTube for inspiration for my next project, I stumbled upon a channel named "Dani," where the creator was instructing his audience on how to make a "Grapple Gun" in Unity. Instantly, I knew I wanted to base my next project around this "Grapple" mechanic in some capacity. I had also been browing Unity's Asset store for deals, and I found a really nice environment pack which also inspired me. These 2 ideas are what kicked off my project. You can find Dani's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgh4v1w5DxU&ab_channel=DanisTutorials), and the environment asset pack [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/toon-fantasy-nature-215197).

## What I want from this Project

* Take my time with this project and learn as much as I can. 
* Have at least 3 levels, with the final one possibly containing a boss fight of some sort. 
* Incorporate 1 puzzle that the player will have to solve to move onto the next level. 
* Have the introduction be intuitive enough to the player so that a tutorial level is not needed.
* Have enemies and/or obstacles that will get in the way of the player.
* Have music and SFX for various actions (getting hit, grappling, collecting an item).
* Have a few collectibles in each level that the player will have the option of collecting.

## Built With

* [Unity](https://www.unity.com)

## Game Design

* The main goal of the game is to swing past enemies and obstacles, and make it to the end of the level.
###### Main Mechanic : Grappling
* In some form or another, I want to include the ability to grapple. There will be predetermined grapple points that the player will have to use to navigate to the end of the level.

## Programming

I had a fun time building the "Ability" system used for the "Big Jump" ability in this game. I used a Coroutine to run the ability script and make sure that it would go on cooldown so the player couldn't spam it frequently. I hooked this up to a UI element to relay that inforation to the player. 

## Art

Some of the art you see in the GIFs are from "Cartoon FX Remaster" [link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/cartoon-fx-remaster-4010), and "World Materials Free" [link](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/textures-materials/world-materials-free-150182). These are no longer present in the current build of the game since I didn't want to take up unwanted space and use HD graphics for this game anymore.

## What I've Learned

I learned that sometimes you can loose motivation to work on a project. I also learned that it happens more quickly when you aren't that invested in the game you are making. I thought I was pushing myself to get outside of my comfort zone by making a 3D platformer (a game genre that I don't play or enjoy all that much), but it turned out to be a detriment to the project itself. While I can still push myself out of my comfort zone, by working in 3D or doing some other genre I don't play as often, I now realize what that can do to my passion for the project.
