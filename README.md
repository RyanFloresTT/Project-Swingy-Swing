## Project Inception

* While browsing on YouTube for inspiration for my next project, I stumbled upon a channel named "Dani," where the creator was instructing his audience on how to make a "Grapple Gun" in Unity. Instantly, I knew I wanted to base my next project around this "Grapple" mechanic in some capacity. I had also been browing Unity's Asset store for deals, and I found a really nice environment pack which also inspired me. These 2 ideas are what kicked off my project. You can find Dani's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgh4v1w5DxU&ab_channel=DanisTutorials), and the environment asset pack [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/landscapes/toon-fantasy-nature-215197).

## What I want from this Project

* Take my time with this project and learn as much as I can. 
* Have at least 3 levels, with the final one possibly containing a boss fight of some sort. 
* Incorporate 1 puzzle that the player will have to solve to move onto the next level. 
* Have the introduction be intuitive enough to the player so that a tutorial level is not needed.
* Have enemies and/or obstacles that will get in the way of the player.
* Have music and SFX for various actions (getting hit, grappling, collecting an item).
* Have a few collectibles in each level that the player will have the option of collecting.

## Built With

* [Unity](https://www.unity.com)

## Game Design

* The main goal of the game is to swing past enemies and obstacles, and make it to the end of the level.
###### Main Mechanic : Grappling
* In some form or another, I want to include the ability to grapple. There will be predetermined grapple points that the player will have to use to navigate to the end of the level.
